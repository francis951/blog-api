# Blog API
This is a simple api that one can perform **CRUD**
# Permissions
It well-secured that not everyone can perform CRUD with this API
its only authenticated users that can perform CRUD
and one has readonly and can't delete or update others post
then one can log in and log out
# User Authentication
create API endpoints for sign up, log in, and log out. using JWTs(Json Web Tokens)
Notably we will use DJOSER in combination with django-allauth to simplify
Djoser is a token base authentication
things.
### User Registration
use the third-party package django-allauth which comes with user registration as well as a number of additional features to the Django
auth system such as social authentication via Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.

# I used  pipenv install drf-yasg2 to document the API
by running:  pipenv install drf-yasg2
